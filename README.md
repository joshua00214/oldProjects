# oldProjects
This is a list of all of my old projects I made throughout highschool, 
Messenger - The client for a messaging program v2 (might have problems with eclipse versions)
Messenger_server - the server for my messenger program v2 (might have problems with eclipse versions)
TicTacToe-Game - a tic tac toe game I made
WEB GAME - A simple game of pong 
Web Calculator - final project I created for the tech club at Highland Software
findNearestPlane - uses OpenSkyAPi to find closest airplane to a user entered GPS cord. Also gives info on the plane
python web scraper - automatically finds the song a certain radio station is playing and plays the song thru youtube (note, the radio station has since updated their website and I have not updated my program)
Calculator.jar - A simple calculator I made in java
TicTacToe.jar - the executable I had for the TicTacToe game
mp3downloader.py - scraps music and downloads it

* It has been awhile since I have programmed some of these projects and since then some of them do not work anymore. These are all personal projects I attemped in an effort to teach myself programming.
